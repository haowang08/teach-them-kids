## 5. Open Questions

1. **Age-appropriate depth:** Should investing/stock market content be simplified for 6-8 year olds or aimed at 9-12?
2. **Real-world currency:** Should we focus on US currency or include examples from multiple countries?
3. **Digital money/crypto:** How much detail on cryptocurrency is appropriate for kids?
4. **Video length:** Many of the best financial literacy videos (Biz Kid$) are ~25 min. Embed full episodes or timestamp segments?
5. **Reward game complexity:** The Bank Manager Simulator is the most complex proposed game — should we simplify it?
