## 3. Content Outline

### Section 1: A City Hidden in the Jungle 🌿
**Read-aloud intro** telling the story of how French explorer Henri Mouhot stumbled upon massive stone temples overtaken by jungle in 1860. He couldn't believe what he was seeing — a lost city bigger than anything in Europe at the time!

**Fun Fact:** At its peak around 1150 CE, Angkor was the largest city in the world, home to nearly 1 million people — at a time when London had only about 50,000!

### Section 2: The Rise of the God-Kings 👑
- Jayavarman II declares independence and founds the Khmer Empire in 802 CE
- The concept of the "Devaraja" (god-king) — kings believed to be connected to Hindu gods
- How the empire grew to control much of mainland Southeast Asia (modern Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam)

**Characters:**
| Emoji | Name | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 👑 | Jayavarman II | The Founder King | Started the Khmer Empire in 802 CE by declaring himself a god-king on sacred Mount Kulen. He united many small kingdoms into one mighty empire! |
| 🏗️ | Suryavarman II | The Master Builder | Built Angkor Wat — the largest religious monument ever constructed! He dedicated it to the Hindu god Vishnu. |
| 🛡️ | Jayavarman VII | The Warrior Healer | After defeating invaders, he rebuilt the empire and constructed over 100 hospitals, roads, and the amazing Angkor Thom city with its giant smiling faces! |

### Section 3: Building Angkor Wat 🏛️
- How they moved 5-10 million sandstone blocks (some weighing up to 1,500 kg) from quarries 50 km away
- The ingenious canal system used to float stones to the building site
- Angkor Wat's design represents Mount Meru, the home of the gods in Hindu mythology
- The 800+ meters of intricate bas-relief carvings — the longest continuous stone carving in the world

**Fun Fact:** Angkor Wat's moat is 190 meters wide and stretches 5.5 km around the entire temple — that's like swimming across 76 Olympic pools laid end to end!

**Video embed:** National Geographic "In Cambodia, a City of Towering Temples in the Forest" (Video 3)

### Section 4: Masters of Water 💧
- The Khmer built massive reservoirs called "barays" — the largest (West Baray) is 8 km long and 2.3 km wide
- Complex canal and irrigation system that fed rice paddies for hundreds of thousands of people
- Water management was the secret to the empire's power — it allowed 3-4 rice harvests per year
- This "hydraulic city" was one of the most advanced water engineering systems in the ancient world

**Fun Fact:** The West Baray held about 50 million cubic meters of water — that's enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools!

### Section 5: Daily Life in Angkor 🐘
- A bustling city with markets, temples, homes on stilts, and royal processions with elephants
- Zhou Daguan's account (a Chinese diplomat who visited in 1296) — one of our best sources
- What kids did: helped with rice farming, learned at temple schools, watched dance performances
- Food: rice as the staple, fish from the Tonle Sap lake, tropical fruits
- Religion: started Hindu, gradually shifted to Buddhism under Jayavarman VII

**Video embed:** TED-Ed "The Cambodian myth of lightning, thunder, and rain" (Video 5)

### Section 6: The Mysterious Decline 🌧️
- Climate change: devastating droughts followed by massive floods damaged the water system
- Wars with the Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya
- The capital moved south to Phnom Penh
- The jungle slowly swallowed the temples for hundreds of years
- Modern rediscovery and the ongoing work to preserve Angkor as a UNESCO World Heritage Site

**Video embed:** Epimetheus "Rise & Fall of the Khmer Empire" (Video 2) covers this period well

### Section 7: Angkor's Legacy Today 🇰🇭
- Angkor Wat appears on Cambodia's flag — the only national flag featuring a building
- Over 2 million tourists visit every year
- Scientists use LIDAR technology to discover new hidden structures under the jungle canopy
- The Khmer Empire's engineering achievements still inspire modern engineers

**Fun Fact:** In 2015, scientists used lasers shot from helicopters (LIDAR) to discover an entire hidden city called Mahendraparvata under the jungle — it was invisible from the ground!

## 7. Reward Game: Temple Builder

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Game Name** | Temple Builder |
| **Game Type** | Builder / Puzzle |
| **Reward Type ID** | `temple-builder` |
| **Celebration Message** | "You've built your own magnificent temple! The Khmer engineers would be proud of your creation! 🏛️🐘✨" |

**Description:** Players build their own Khmer-style temple complex by placing stone blocks, adding carved decorations, constructing a moat, and building a canal system to bring water. The game has stages:

1. **Foundation:** Place sandstone blocks to create the base pyramid (drag-and-drop)
2. **Towers:** Stack towers in the iconic Angkor Wat style (central tower tallest, 4 surrounding)
3. **Decorations:** Choose bas-relief carvings to add to the walls (mythological scenes)
4. **Water System:** Draw canals connecting your temple to a reservoir, then watch water flow through your system and rice paddies turn green
5. **Grand Reveal:** Zoom out to see your complete temple complex with animated people, elephants in procession, and monks chanting

**Key Learning Reinforcement:** The building process teaches kids about Khmer architecture, the importance of water engineering, and how temples were designed to represent cosmic mountains.
